<p>In 2020 I started to take notes, write reviews and short summaries of the books I read to help me remember the content. I use <a href="http://www.roamresearch.com">Roam Research</a> to link them all together.</p>

<p>I don't recommend reading someone else's notes in place of reading the book. I'm sharing them here in the hope that they help someone find something new, or make a connection. If you find them useful, I'd love to hear about it!</p>

<p>The scores below aren't to compare books, they're how likely I'd recommend the book to someone - (1) being "avoid at all costs", (10) being "grab a copy".</p>

<ul>
  
    
      <h2><a href="/dont-go-there-by-svetlana-oss">DON'T GO THERE BY SVETLANA OSS</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 5/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/3kdkram" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/dont-go-there-by-svetlana-oss"><img src="/assets/images/book-dont-go-there.jpg" alt="Don't go there by Svetlana Oss book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>In 1959 nine university students were found dead in the Russian Ural mountains in mysterious circumstances. They had been on a mountaineering trip; their tent was ripped open and the bodies were found not far. Nobody knows with certainty what happened, at least not anyone who’s willing to come forward with the details. This is what’s known as “The Dyatlov Pass Incident”. Svetlana introduces us to the students, outlining their steps and the details of the macabre discovery; along the way photos and excerpts from journal entries bring this to life. We get a critique of various theories; was it an avalanche, military test, espionage, a UFO (meteor or celestial body) or an act of local tribes? Eventually this concludes with a rationale of the most likely explanation. I found the book engaging and although it’s made clear early on that there isn’t a definitive answer I was satisfied by the end that the author’s conclusion has firm grounding.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/unlimited-memory-by-kevin-horsley">UNLIMITED MEMORY BY KEVIN HORSLEY</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 4/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/3hklrrl" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/unlimited-memory-by-kevin-horsley"><img src="/assets/images/memory.jpg" alt="Unlimited Memory by Kevin Horsley book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>Some powerful strategies for memorisation and recall. Quite a bit is overly explained; the techniques are simple (a good thing). I skimmed over fluff and pulled out what I thought could be useful. I have no need to remember long strings of numbers, but linking names and information to images and other associations is something I’ll use.</p>

    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/guide-to-happiness-teachings-epicurus">A GUIDE TO HAPPINESS - TEACHINGS OF EPICURUS</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 8/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/2RdvCTN" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/guide-to-happiness-teachings-epicurus"><img src="/assets/images/guidetohappiness.jpg" alt="A guide to happiness - teachings of Epicurus book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>Over 2000 years have passed since Epicurus wrote these teachings, yet they still provide great insight into how to live happily. The best are: “Nothing satisfies him for whom enough is too little”; “if you wish to make Pythocles rich, be not adding to do his money but subtracting from his desires” and “the greatest fruit of self-sufficiency is freedom”.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-by-Cal-Newport">SO GOOD THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU - BY CAL NEWPORT</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 8/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/3imnk80" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-by-Cal-Newport"><img src="/assets/images/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you.jpg" alt="So Good They Can't Ignore You - by Cal Newport book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>An alternative to the famous “follow your passion” advice. It’s well argued and I can relate personally. I’ve found work I’m passionate about, but as a student I’d not even heard of my industry. Following your passion sounds great, but that assumes you know your passion, and that following it will provide you with a successful and meaningful career (there are examples in the book to illustrate how it can lead you astray). For me the work, skills and purpose came over time. There are definitely exceptions (sports being one), but for many it’s great advice; get out there and start working to discover your passion and earn options to pursue it. One of the best career advice books I’ve read.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/extreme-ownership-by-jocko-willink">EXTREME OWNERSHIP - BY JOCKO WILLINK AND LEIF BABIN</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 9/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/3k0E3y4" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/extreme-ownership-by-jocko-willink"><img src="/assets/images/extreme-ownership.jpg" alt="Extreme Ownership - by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>I really like the concept of Extreme Ownership; a leader owns everything in their world, “there is no-one else to blame”. It’s written by two ex U.S. Navy SEAL officers who served in Iraq. Each leadership principle is given along with examples from their time in combat, as well as what they’ve seen whilst consulting in industry. All the principles in the book are important, however some of the chapters are better than others; in terms of the combat story, principle and business story pattern each follows. In particular “no bad teams, only bad leaders” was standout for me. It’s definitely something I’ll use and recommend to others. To borrow a line from the book, what’s in there is simple, but it isn’t easy. A must read for leaders of any rank.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/forever-employable-by-jeff-gothelf">FOREVER EMPLOYABLE - BY JEFF GOTHELF</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 6/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/2FqJ0kM" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/forever-employable-by-jeff-gothelf"><img src="/assets/images/f-emp.jpg" alt="Forever Employable - by Jeff Gothelf book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>I like the way Jeff takes us through his personal epiphany that led to the central idea of this book; to become a well known expert in a particular niche and have employers seek you out. The message is good but you really could get the key points across in an article (it’s a very short book as it is). Useful enough to recommend though.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/operation-mincemeat-by-ben-macyntyre">OPERATION MINCEMEAT - BY BEN MACINTYRE</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 9/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/32fCPsY" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/operation-mincemeat-by-ben-macyntyre"><img src="/assets/images/op-mm.jpg" alt="Operation Mincemeat - by Ben Macintyre book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>Fascinating account of one of the strangest and most daring deceptions of the Second World War. The details and pace are such that it’s hard to put down. Little wonder so many within intelligence at the time, such as Ian Fleming, were or became novelists. Fiction inspired real life which went on to inspire fiction. As the author states, we’ll never really know the extent to which Mincemeat helped the invasion of Sicily over other deception activities going on (such as the fake army build ups, activities in Greece etc). But if it wasn’t the key element, it played a big role. An important story to tell, and well told.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/antifragile-by-nassim-taleb">ANTIFRAGILE - BY NASSIM TALEB</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 10/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/33i0yIb" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/antifragile-by-nassim-taleb"><img src="/assets/images/antifragile.jpg" alt="Antifragile - by Nassim Taleb book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>Taleb’s style is rough around the edges. That’s what’s so refreshing about him and his work. We need outsiders; challenging the status quo, providing different perspectives and calling out bullshit. Antifragile takes us across disciplines to look at what’s causing fragility in our systems and economies, why and how we can resolve them using the concept of antifragility.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/forty-stories-anton-chekhov">FORTY STORIES - BY ANTON CHEKHOV</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 8/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/3k6Hofb" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/forty-stories-anton-chekhov"><img src="/assets/images/forty.jpg" alt="Forty Stories - by Anton Chekhov book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>A brilliant collection; Chekhov is master of the short story. In a few pages, he can bring you closer to a character than many authors can over the course of a novel. These stories add up to a vivid picture of 19th century Russia with a patchwork of characters spanning classes. Kindness, innocence, guilt, miserliness and cruelty are all on display in sometimes surprising and somewhat shocking situations. Personally I found The Little Apples, The Ninny, The Huntsman, The Malefactor, The Peasant Women, After the Theatre, The Lady with the Pet Dog and The Bride to be the most interesting.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/the-spy-and-the-traitor-by-ben-macyntyre">THE SPY AND THE TRAITOR - BY BEN MACINTYRE</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 9/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/32fXHA8" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/the-spy-and-the-traitor-by-ben-macyntyre"><img src="/assets/images/sandt.jpg" alt="The Spy and The Traitor - by Ben Macintyre book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>A gripping true spy thriller. This is the perfect combination: an incredible story, well written. I couldn’t put this down. Gordievsky harboured a huge secret, for a long time, and right under his enemies noses. The Soviet Union’s top man, a mole? If you made this up, people would tell you it’s far fetched. Who needs fiction when there are these stories to be told.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/team-topologies-by-matthew-skelton-and-manuel-pais">TEAM TOPOLOGIES - BY MATTHEW SKELTON AND MANUEL PAIS</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 7.5/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/32iMUFG" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/team-topologies-by-matthew-skelton-and-manuel-pais"><img src="/assets/images/team-top.jpg" alt="Team Topologies - by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>The authors have pulled together a lot of wisdom to create some simple, easy to use patterns for team design. It provides many examples, diagrams and case studies which makes them “real”. The central points are simple (that’s the point), so the book could be a lot shorter but I’d certainly recommend it to anyone setting up teams and I’m sure I’ll refer back to it.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2><a href="/endurance-shackletons-incredible-voyage-by-alfred-lansing">ENDURANCE - SHACKLETON'S INCREDIBLE VOYAGE BY ALFRED LANSING</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 9/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/2RdUs63" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/endurance-shackletons-incredible-voyage-by-alfred-lansing"><img src="/assets/images/endurance.jpg" alt="Endurance - Shackleton's Incredible Voyage by Alfred Lansing book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>The most exhilarating and inspiring true account of leadership that you’ll find. Endurance is so well written that the whole book had me on the edge of my seat. The story that unfolds is one of a leader able to hold his nerve whilst maintaining a group together in some of the most challenging conditions on the planet. Shackleton sets a fantastic example for leaders to follow: staying attuned to his men’s moods, knowing their strengths, weaknesses and making decisions accordingly. He set the example he wanted them to follow, led from the front and always had a clear objective. This helped keep them alive in what must have seemed an impossible situation. If you want to be entertained, inspired or to learn about leadership then this book is essential.</p>
