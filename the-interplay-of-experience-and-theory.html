<p>You learn from the bruises. They come with experience.</p>

<p>Experience give you a frame of reference for theory.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve learned the most in areas that I was thrown into earlier in my career, before I knew what good looked like.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been wondering why itâ€™s so powerful a learning experience to do something first and learn about it on the job, applying new knowledge (theory) afterwards.</p>

<p>Without a doubt the power of this is being able to bring to mind examples that relate to what youâ€™re learning. But I think itâ€™s deeper than that. Youâ€™re not limiting yourself to looking through the prism of theory only. Youâ€™re using it to illuminate a much broader experience.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s use an analogy.</p>

<p><strong>Experience is like knowing the terrain of an island.</strong></p>

<p>You know every nook and cranny. But you donâ€™t know where the treasure is buried.</p>

<p>You may find it by trial and error. You may work out the hard way where the quicksand is.</p>

<p><img class="lead-image" src="/assets/images/article-assets/a-experience-white-bg.jpg" alt="experience is like an island" style="max-width:100%;" /></p>

<p><strong>Theory is like learning where the treasure is buried.</strong></p>

<p>You know where to look, but first you have to get to the spot. Youâ€™re not prepared for that. Youâ€™ve never seen quicksand beforeâ€¦</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll probably get there eventually. But itâ€™s going to be hard. In theory it was straightforward.</p>

<p><img class="lead-image" src="/assets/images/article-assets/a-theory-white-bg.jpg" alt="theory is the route" style="max-width:100%;" /></p>

<p><strong>If you know the terrain well, you can apply the theory well. It will fit into place, you know what to expect.</strong></p>

<p>For me, a great example was in leadership. It wasnâ€™t something Iâ€™d aimed for or given much thought to, I emulated the leaders around me, I had successes and I made mistakes. I saw, experienced and partook in the good and the bad. Having built and led teams, when I dig into books like <a href="/extreme-ownership-by-jocko-willink" target="blank">Extreme Ownership</a>
they really hit home. I recall what I did well but more often than not see what I could have done better.</p>

<p>Applying the knowledge to past experience brings deep learning and improvement.</p>
