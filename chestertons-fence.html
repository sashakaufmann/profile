<p>The Chesterton‚Äôs Fence principle is: <b>Before you make any rash reforms, understand why decisions were made in the first place.</b></p>

<p>This is so simple that it sounds like common sense, but it‚Äôs easy to forget.</p>

<p>My line of work in software delivery and ways of working is all about reform; evolutionary reform but reform none the less. I see things that go against proven principles or good practices and often quickly gain an idea of how we might make improvements; of experiments to run. Chesterton‚Äôs Fence reminds me to look deeper first; I‚Äôve never found anything to prevent reform but understanding past decisions provides a firm foundation to build on.</p>

<p>The term comes from Gilbert Chesterton, an English writer and philosopher. In his 1929 work ‚Äò<i>The Thing</i>‚Äô he describes a reformer coming up against an institution or law and compares it to a fence or gate erected across a road: <i>‚ÄúThe more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the use of this; let us clear it away.‚Äù To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt see the use of it, I certainly won‚Äôt let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can comeback and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.‚Äù</i></p>

<p>The point is that if you don‚Äôt understand why something was put in place and only look superficially, you may miss second or third order effects. To put it another way: consequences¬≤. Of course this sounds obvious but it‚Äôs often ignored as we rush ahead, assume we know better or don‚Äôt look before we leap.</p>

<p>An example. You‚Äôre starting a new job. Eager and capable of spotting things that can be improved, you want to prove yourself and make things happen. As tempting as it is to jump in, it‚Äôs wise to observe and seek to understand the whole; why everything is in place <i>before</i> making changes.</p>

<p>Management structures are a typical example of Chesterton‚Äôs fence. Without doubt they can be convoluted and unnecessary, but many organisations that get flattened go on to re-create them. It turns out they‚Äôre useful; supporting employees, providing clear and manageable communication channels and for decision making. Examples of lessons come from Google, Zappos, Medium and Github.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take it up a notch. As systems get more complex, so do the effects of changes we make. The environment provides many examples, here are a couple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the American West‚Äôs prevention of small wildfires leading to less frequent but much bigger more damaging fires.</li>
  <li>a Chinese campaign to kill Sparrows to increase grain yields that actually decreased them since Sparrows eat a large amount of insects as well as the grains.</li>
</ul>

<p>What we need to remember is to avoid making assumptions, to observe more, ask more questions and really understand past decisions before moving ahead. Returning to my own line of work, even things that are seemingly just plain wrong warrant time to ensure you know why they‚Äôre being done. Either you‚Äôll be justified in the reform, discover and avert a hidden consequence, or simply learn something that lends weight to what you‚Äôre proposing.</p>

<p>We should applaud challengers, reformers and innovators. What it takes to avoid Chesterton‚Äôs fence is taking the time to understand previous decisions and the implications of reversing them before making new ones.</p>
