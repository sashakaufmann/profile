<p>The Chesterton‚Äôs Fence principle is: <b>Before you make any rash reforms, understand why decisions were made in the first place.</b></p>

<p>I‚Äôve slipped into this trap before. When helping organisations develop new ways of working, it‚Äôs tempting to jump right in with improvements and experiments.</p>

<p>Chesterton‚Äôs Fence is a reminder to look deeper first. I‚Äôve never found anything to prevent change, but understanding past decisions provides a firm foundation for the work to come.</p>

<p>The term comes from Gilbert Chesterton, an English writer and philosopher. In his 1929 work ‚Äò<i>The Thing</i>‚Äô he describes a reformer coming up against an institution or law and compares it to a fence or gate erected across a road: <i>‚ÄúThe more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the use of this; let us clear it away.‚Äù To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt see the use of it, I certainly won‚Äôt let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can comeback and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.‚Äù</i></p>

<p>The point is that if you don‚Äôt understand why something was put in place and only look superficially, you may miss second or third order effects. Of course this sounds obvious but it‚Äôs often ignored as we rush ahead, assume we know better or don‚Äôt look before we leap.</p>

<p>An example. You‚Äôre starting a new job. Eager and capable of spotting things that can be improved, you want to prove yourself. As tempting as it is to jump in, it‚Äôs wise to observe and seek to understand the whole system <i>before</i> making changes.</p>

<p>Management structures are a typical example of Chesterton‚Äôs fence. Without doubt they can be convoluted and unnecessary, but many organisations that get flattened go on to re-create them. It turns out they‚Äôre useful; for decision making, to provide clear and manageable communication channels and for supporting employees. Examples of lessons come from Google, Zappos, Medium and Github.</p>

<p>As systems get more complex, so do the effects of changes we make. The environment provides a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the American West‚Äôs prevention of small wildfires leading to less frequent but much bigger more damaging fires.</li>
  <li>a Chinese campaign to kill Sparrows to increase grain yields that actually decreased them since Sparrows eat a large amount of insects as well as the grains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to spot second order effects can be catastrophic. So what can we do to improve our own decision making? Remember to avoid assumptions, to observe more, ask more questions and really understand past decisions before moving ahead. Returning to my own experience, even things that are seemingly just plain wrong warrant time to ensure you know why they‚Äôre being done. Either you‚Äôll be justified in the reform, discover and avert a hidden consequence, or simply learn something that lends weight to what you‚Äôre proposing.</p>

<p>We should applaud challengers, reformers and innovators. Chesterton‚Äôs fence isn‚Äôt about halting change, it‚Äôs about learning. We should all take the time to understand previous decisions and the implications of reversing them before making new ones.</p>
