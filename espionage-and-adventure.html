<h2><a href="/agent-zigzag-by-ben-macntyre">AGENT ZIGZAG BY BEN MACINTYRE</a></h2>

      <a href="/agent-zigzag-by-ben-macntyre"><img src="/assets/images//book-assets/book-zigzag.jpeg" alt="Agent Zigzag by Ben Macintyre book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>The true story of one of Britain’s most notorious double agents, Eddie Chapman. A smooth criminal, prisoner, agent of German Abwehr and finally a British double agent. The lines between all his roles blurred and espionage gave him the same rush as crime. He may have been the kind of man who would look you in the eye as he picked your pocket, but what’s clear is that he did Britain a great service at a great deal of personal risk. A colourful character and a story so wild that you couldn’t have made it up; as with Macintyre’s other books I enjoyed every minute of it.</p>

German Jewish communist, mother, radio technician, writer, spy and spymaster. Carrying out covert activities through the horrors of Nazism; in Japanese occupied China, spy ridden Switzerland and in the rolling hills of the Cotswolds. The engrossing life story of an idealistic (albeit ultimately misguided), determined and very tough woman. Recommended.</p>

    
    
 
 	
<h2><a href="/into-thin-air-by-jon-krakauer">INTO THIN AIR BY JON KRAKAUER</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 7/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/352qd9z" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/into-thin-air-by-jon-krakauer"><img src="/assets/images//book-assets/book-intothinair.jpg" alt="Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>This is an account of the 1996 Everest disaster by a journalist who was with one of the groups. Eight climbers lost their lives; the author attempts to get to the heart of what happened up there. It’s rarely a single mistake that creates these events. In this case we learn about the commercialisation of Everest, the danger of inexperienced climbers paying to be taken up, the competition between tour groups and the myriad of human errors that happen when the brain is starved of oxygen. As fascinating as the subject is, the book is brilliantly written, with an engaging build up and a pace that keeps the page turning. This one went quickly.</p>

    
    
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
<h2><a href="/touching-the-void-by-joe-simpson">TOUCHING THE VOID BY JOE SIMPSON</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 7/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/2VahmNx" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/touching-the-void-by-joe-simpson"><img src="/assets/images//book-assets/book-touching-the-void.jpg" alt="Touching the Void by Joe Simpson book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>Take heart from the fact that no matter what life throws at you, you’ll never have it worse than being stuck halfway up a mountain alone, with your knee smashed to pieces.</p>

<p>The two climbers in this book took a stupid risk and nearly paid the ultimate price. What they went through though makes for one hell of a survival story. The first third of the book is boring for someone who doesn’t climb as it takes us on their ascent. Once Joe breaks his leg things suddenly get very tense, ramping up each time the situation gets more desperate. The emotions he goes through, the guilt of Simon who cut Joe loose, the ebb and flow of determination and hopelessness that got him to camp. It’s powerful stuff.</p>

    
    
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
<h2><a href="/operation-mincemeat-by-ben-macyntyre">OPERATION MINCEMEAT - BY BEN MACINTYRE</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 9/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/32fCPsY" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/operation-mincemeat-by-ben-macyntyre"><img src="/assets/images//book-assets/op-mm.jpg" alt="Operation Mincemeat - by Ben Macintyre book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>Fascinating account of one of the strangest and most daring deceptions of the Second World War. The details and pace are such that it’s hard to put down. Little wonder so many within intelligence at the time, such as Ian Fleming, were or became novelists. Fiction inspired real life which went on to inspire fiction. As the author states, we’ll never really know the extent to which Mincemeat helped the invasion of Sicily over other deception activities going on (such as the fake army build ups, activities in Greece etc). But if it wasn’t the key element, it played a big role. An important story to tell, and well told.</p>

      <a href="/the-spy-and-the-traitor-by-ben-macyntyre"><img src="/assets/images//book-assets/sandt.jpg" alt="The Spy and The Traitor - by Ben Macintyre book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>A gripping true spy thriller. This is the perfect combination: an incredible story, well written. I couldn’t put this down. Gordievsky harboured a huge secret, for a long time, and right under his enemies noses. The Soviet Union’s top man, a mole? If you made this up, people would tell you it’s far fetched. Who needs fiction when there are these stories to be told.</p>


    
    
 
 	
 
 	
 
 	
<h2><a href="/endurance-shackletons-incredible-voyage-by-alfred-lansing">ENDURANCE - SHACKLETON'S INCREDIBLE VOYAGE BY ALFRED LANSING</a></h2>
      <b>Recommendation: 9/10</b>
      | <a href="https://amzn.to/2RdUs63" target="blank">Reviews on Amazon*</a>
      <a href="/endurance-shackletons-incredible-voyage-by-alfred-lansing"><img src="/assets/images//book-assets/endurance.jpg" alt="Endurance - Shackleton's Incredible Voyage by Alfred Lansing book cover" style="height: 200px; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px;" /></a><p>The most exhilarating and inspiring true account of leadership that you’ll find. Endurance is so well written that the whole book had me on the edge of my seat. The story that unfolds is one of a leader able to hold his nerve whilst maintaining a group together in some of the most challenging conditions on the planet. Shackleton sets a fantastic example for leaders to follow: staying attuned to his men’s moods, knowing their strengths, weaknesses and making decisions accordingly. He set the example he wanted them to follow, led from the front and always had a clear objective. This helped keep them alive in what must have seemed an impossible situation. If you want to be entertained, inspired or to learn about leadership then this book is essential.</p>
