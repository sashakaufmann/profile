<p>Productivity apps draw me in.</p>

<p>Theyâ€™re new toys to play with, and thereâ€™s always the possibility of improving my workflow. But when it comes to tasks on a day to day basis I always seem to return to the notepad next to my desk.</p>

<p>Not some smartly laid out and pristine notebook, just whatever blank book I have to scribble into.</p>

<p>My system is simple. If something Iâ€™ve jotted down has an action for me, it has a check box next to it. At the start and end of each day I scan the last couple of pages to remind myself of whatâ€™s outstanding. Ideally Iâ€™ll have got to an action by the time it falls a couple of pages back.</p>

<p>The consequence of this is that if I havenâ€™t done something by the time Iâ€™m a few pages ahead, itâ€™s binned. This is a good thing! Clearly it wasnâ€™t that important, and since the book is right in front of me all day and I review whatâ€™s there regularly, I naturally see anything not getting done. If itâ€™s important enough to warrent more focus Iâ€™ll keep it at the front of the list by noting it again. Otherwise Iâ€™ll either leave it or cross it out completely. I donâ€™t really care much about sizing, but itâ€™s easy to tell when somethingâ€™s too big and will be hanging around too long. If itâ€™s going to take more than a day Iâ€™ll generally break it into smaller actions.</p>

<p>I keep returning to this system because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Itâ€™s the fastest way by far to note something that needs doing. Especially the small things. 0 clicks.</li>
  <li>Leads to action on those small things, because if they donâ€™t get done soon they wonâ€™t get done at all. Itâ€™s a forcing function.</li>
  <li>It keeps the big things at front of mind and encourages me to break them down to make progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>The constraints in my system are an enabler. If I used A3 instead of A5 pages, I wouldnâ€™t be as focussed, more work would build up and itâ€™d take longer to go through it. Physically only being able to see a couple of pages at a time creates focus and the effort of flicking back means that well, you donâ€™t. It also forces me to get things done, because if I leave them to fall too far back I probably wonâ€™t do them.</p>

<p>I still use a couple of different apps for goals, notes and other stuff, but theyâ€™ll never be as available as my scratchpad. The process of gravitating towards the path of least resistance like this is natural. Thereâ€™s a subconscious cost/benefit analysis going on that moves you towards the most efficient route, as long as itâ€™s still effective. Thatâ€™s why when designing any process or way of working, donâ€™t fight the path of least resistance, find it. Itâ€™s the most effective way to get to your goal.</p>
