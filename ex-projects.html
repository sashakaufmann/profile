<p>First CMS I used was Joomla. I built a community site for Mexican artists and had signups from every state.</p>

<p>Daily Scrum twitter bot - built with Ruby. Followed by some well known Agilists. I regret scrapping it whilst it was gaining traction (didn’t want to pay for hosting). It would probably have 1000s of followers by now.</p>

<p>A handful of personal websites built with WordPress and Drupal.</p>
