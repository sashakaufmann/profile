				<h2 class="work-heading">Work</h2>
				<p>My bread and butter is using Lean and Agile to deliver outcomes, transform organisations, engage and inspire teams. I apply an approach that fits the context. I'm not a man with a hammer looking for a nail. I write about building better organisations on the <a href="https://www.learning-race.com" target="_blank"> Learning Race blog</a>, covering topics including ways of working, communication, management, continuous improvement and leadership.</p>
				<p>Find out more about me professionally on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashakaufmann/" target="_blank">LinkedIn.</a></p>
				
				<h2>Family</h2>
				<p>On <a href="https://www.dad-idea.com" target="_blank">Dad-idea</a> I post content featuring fun, educational and plain crazy (good crazy) things to try with kids - based on activities and ideas I've tried with my own little people. Inventor of Rock Friday™ among other ridiculous games and traditions. I wrote a short <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Short-stories-children-Five-animal-ebook/dp/B00MSSA5N4/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=sasha+kaufmann&qid=1587567662&sr=8-2" target="_blank">book of animal fables</a> for my daughters.</p>
				
 				<h2>Interests</h2>
				 <p>I love to learn and write. I'm fascinated by the application of ideas across disciplines. I'm into <a href=/notes>books</a>, personal growth, functional strength, localism, growing my own food. I'm on <a href= "https://twitter.com/kaufie7" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, occasional tweets, but for me it's mostly a tool for discovering new stuff in specific fields.</p>
			
			<h2>Favourite quotes</h2>	
				<p>I constantly try to remember these.</p>
				<p class= "quote">“Man is affected not by events but by the view he takes of them.”</p>
				<p class= "quote">“Things that were hard to bear are sweet to remember.”</p>
				<p class="quoted">-SENECA</p>
				
		 		 <p class= "quote">“We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery.”</p><p class="quoted">-SAMUEL SMILES</p>
				 
				 <p class= "quote">“Trickery and treachery are the practices of fools that have not the wits enough to be honest.”</p><p class="quoted">-BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</p>

 <p class= "quote">“Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.”</p><p class= "quote"> "It is impossible to begin to learn what one thinks one already knows."</p><p class="quoted">-EPICTETUS</p>
