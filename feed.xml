&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-we-measure&quot;&gt;What should we measure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Measurement is fabulous. Unless you’re busy measuring what’s easy to measure as opposed to what’s important.”[1]&lt;br /&gt;
 	&lt;i&gt;- Seth Godin (Author and entrepreneur)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous chapter we saw the difference between leading and lagging indicators, and what can happen if you measure something that’s only loosely aligned to your overall goals. You’d be surprised at how many leaders use other people’s metrics to assess how things are going, even when they provide little information on whether business results are being achieved or values acted upon. I’ve witnessed managers obsessing over teams’ velocity&lt;i&gt;[2]&lt;/i&gt; whilst remaining ignorant of whether it bore any relation to the business outcomes (it didn’t). But, it’s easy to measure and other teams use it, so they latched onto it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, similar organisations may be looking to achieve the same thing, and in those cases metrics may be alike. But that’s the wrong place to start. A measurement should provide information that helps you decide what to do next. It needs to take you in the direction of your goals and values. The weaker the relationship between what you’re measuring and what you actually want to achieve, the less useful that information is. Using it to decide on what to do next could mean setting off on the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is for organisations taking on progressive values, including but not limited to those shared by the Agile movement. If you’re moving in that direction, then you’ll need build the following organisation abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ORIENT&lt;/b&gt;. Have a clear view of progress towards outcomes, so that measures can be taken to support teams to correct or change course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESPOND&lt;/b&gt;. React and adapt to changing requirements, so that a firm can better compete in a complex and changing environment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMMUNICATE&lt;/b&gt;. Creating an environment where individuals value one another and can be open, so that problems are exposed early and the creativity and potential of people can be leveraged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;LEARN&lt;/b&gt;. To cultivate a culture of reflection and continuous improvement throughout the organisation. Across people, process and product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building and improving these abilities isn’t easy but it will set you up for the best possible chance of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[2] Velocity is a metric used by some Scrum teams: the number of ‘story points’ completed within a sprint. More on this later.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly&quot;&gt;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at developing our Organisational Abilities, we’ll encounter The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen that &lt;b&gt;Good metrics&lt;/b&gt; are an indicator related to the goal we’re trying to achieve. They provide us with information that helps us decide what to do next to achieve that goal. Working integrated software, customer satisfaction and conversion rates are examples of good metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bad metrics&lt;/b&gt; mislead us. The information they provide does not have a meaningful bearing on our goal. When we use them to made decisions, we may as well have flipped a coin. At worst they influence decisions by sending us in the wrong direction. Bad metrics are usually measured with the best of intentions. They’re just not thought through. In software, velocity is useful for a team but it’s a bad metric for managers to use because it can be gamed at the expense of actual results. In sales, looking at sales numbers is important, but if returns and customer satisfaction aren’t taken into account then sales numbers can go up at the expense of future goodwill and profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ugly metrics&lt;/b&gt; are seriously dysfunctional, sometimes tyrannical. They’re less about the goal, and more about control or dominance. Avoid these like the plague, and if you meet or work for someone using them - question whether it’s the right place for you. I recently saw a video-calling feature being advertised to managers by an analytics company. They allow the managers to track the number and duration of video-call meetings taking place. You can imagine how this could easily be misused. Employees may set up meetings they don’t even need to meet their quota. What a powerful way for managers to make a company look busy whilst killing productivity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future pages we’ll revisit the Good, Bad and Ugly pattern in relation to metrics associated with abilities discussed in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-cases-for-metrics&quot;&gt;Use cases for metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a summary of what we should measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Common needs of managers in organisations:&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;We will look at how to:&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Ability to:&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;I want to know if we’re on track, so that I can take measures to alter our course. Correct, pivot or ditch.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Measure progress and forecast.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Orient - Chapter 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;I want to know and improve our ability to respond to change so that we can more quickly and effectively adapt to changing markets.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Measure and improve our agility.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Respond - Chapter 4&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;I want to increase our openness and transparency internally so that problems are exposed early and we can leverage the creativity and potential of our people.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Measure and improve openness.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Communicate - Chapter 5&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;I want to know we are evolving; improving what we are doing.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Measure and improve the culture of learning and continuous improvement.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Learn - Chapter 6&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We’ll be exploring each of these individually in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/good-bad-ugly&quot;&gt;next page (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sash</name></author><category term="organisational-abilities" /><category term="measurement" /><summary type="html">Chapter 2 looks at what to measure in your organisation.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CHAPTER 1 - Terms</title><link href="https://kaufie.com/options-and-outcomes" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CHAPTER 1 - Terms" /><published>2020-09-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://kaufie.com/options-and-outcomes</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kaufie.com/options-and-outcomes">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/leading-and-lagging-indicators&quot;&gt;&amp;lt; previous page (Leading and Lagging Indicators)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outcomes-options-and-tasks&quot;&gt;Outcomes, Options and Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There many frameworks, methods and practices for breaking work down. I like to keep things simple, and where possible universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;b&gt;Outcome&lt;/b&gt; is a high level business objective. Something that happens as the result of something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get an outcome, you need &lt;b&gt;Options&lt;/b&gt;. These can be actions or outputs that once completed contribute to the outcome in a measurable way. There may be many options that would satisfy an outcome. It’s up to you to decide which is best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To carry out an Option, whether it’s building something or doing something, you’ll need to carry out &lt;b&gt;Tasks&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outcome: Increased market share 
Options: New social share features on website. Advertising campaign. Takeover competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Options can be broken down into small Options - we’ll get to why that’s a good idea and look at some examples in Chapter 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some common terms and how they relate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User stories - called such to emphasise the value of understanding within the team, and from the perspective of who a feature is for, what it is and what the purpose of it is. A user story would be an option as would any parent big picture item, often called an “Epic”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Requirements - these would be a subset of an Option. Criteria to tell us what should be included. Rarely of value on their own, typically in Agile requirements manifest as acceptance criteria within user stories.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Bets - I like the implication that we don’t know if it will work. All options in the complex context are bets. When you move into the simple or complicated context and you start dealing  with sure things, the term “option” holds better and more broadly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leading-and-lagging-indicators&quot;&gt;Leading and lagging indicators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the difference between leading and lagging indicators, let’s look at a simple example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter is learning how to play the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more she practices, the better she’ll get. There’s a link between how much practice she puts in and the desired outcome, in this case good guitar playing skills. Hours practiced is a leading indicator. It provides us with information we can use to predict the future outcome before it has materialised. More practice means better guitar playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leading indicator: A measurement that provides information on what a situation or outcome may be in the future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that I’ve said &lt;i&gt;‘may’&lt;/i&gt; rather than ‘will’. Since a leading indicator predicts the future, it guides us but that doesn’t mean it will always be accurate. Sticking to the example I’ve used, there’s a well known correlation between practice and success in most activities, which makes practice a good leading indicator to influence for musical success. But, if I were to pick up the same guitar, it’s possible that no amount of practice will make me good at it. Still, it’s the best way to have a shot at becoming a rockstar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other examples of leading indicators: the results of safety inspections as a leading indicator for safety in manufacturing companies; claims for unemployment benefit as a leading indicator for the economy; employee satisfaction as a leading indicator for staff retention; the smell coming from the kitchen as a leading indicator of a good meal. It’s not always straightforward to identify leading indicators, but when you do, you have a powerful lever for achieving your desired results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading indicators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help us look forward to future outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are typically harder to measure than lagging, but easier and more powerful to influence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predict what may happen with accuracy that varies according to the strength of the relationship between indicator and result. [1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lagging indicators are much easier to measure, since they’re the result of past actions. This is generally an output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to the example I gave of my guitar playing daughter, the lagging indicator for her skill (the desired outcome) could be the number of tunes she can play, or number of errors in the tunes. Easy to measure, however harder to leverage and influence. If she knows that practice helps her to improve, and she works on that leading indicator (in this case practicing more), she knows it will improve her proficiency. In contrast, the lagging indicators show the results of past actions and as such are only useful in telling us how we’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lagging indicator: A measurement that provides information on what a situation has been like in the past.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focussing on lagging indicators can be counter productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“People do what you count, not necessarily what counts” [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you focus on the indicator, it can lead to optimising for output over outcome. In our musical example, let’s say we focus on the lagging indicator ‘number of errors’. This could influence my daughter to pick easy, or short tunes which will indeed most likely lead to fewer errors. However, if our desired outcome is improved guitar skill then this is missing the point. A complicated tune with a few errors is surely demonstrating more skill than an easy song with none. In business this kind of focus on outputs over outcomes is common. It could be a development team hitting targets for the number of features delivered, whilst not delivering business results; or a manufacturing plant hitting targets for the number of units delivered, but causing the business to loose money with high levels of returns due to defects. That’s why &lt;b&gt;we need to be really careful of what we measure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other examples of typical lagging indicators: number of sales, number of projects delivered, revenue, staff turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lagging indicators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look backwards, showing us the results of past actions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Typically emphasise outputs over outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are easy to measure, but do not provide the leverage to improve. By the time you’re looking at the result, it’s too late to do anything about it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be gamed, at the expense of the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? &lt;b&gt;Think of the leading indicators as the rudder of a ship. You use them to steer and change course. The lagging indicators should be the radar system and GPS. They show where you are. Used together in the right way they are important tools to achieve desired outcomes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[1] Practice is closely related to guitar skill, but if I use quality of service in a restaurant as a leading indicator for a great meal, I may be disappointed (or surprised) more often than not when I get a bad meal with impeccable service, or vice versa.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the terms measurements, metrics and KPIs are used interchangeably, however there are some differences. Measurement is defined by Douglas W. Hubbard in his excellent book “How to Measure Anything”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Measurement: a set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity.
[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A measurement should provide us with information that helps us decide what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, lets say that managers in one organisation want to improve staff retention. They carry out a set of actions, measuring staff turnover before and after. If turnover has reduced, then they have an indication that what they have done has worked, they either keep doing it, tweak it or do nothing. If it hasn’t, then they know something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although often used interchangeably with measurement, a metric is the product of a calculation, a method for measurement or a measurement from a standardised system. For example, a telecoms operator uses a customer churn metric to measure how well they’re doing at retaining customers (number of churned customers / total number of customers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term key performance indicator (KPI) refers to measurements or metrics that are specifically used in relation to business related objectives. They signal that this is an important measurement for success. Going back to our previous example of the customer churn metric, if this is something the company will want to move the needle on, it will be considered a KPI.&lt;/p&gt;

Quite a bit is overly explained; the techniques are simple (a good thing). I skimmed over fluff and pulled out what I thought could be useful. I have no need to remember long strings of numbers, but linking names and information to images and other associations is something I’ll use.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-big-idea&quot;&gt;The big idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the senses and your imagination to enhance memory. Associate numbers and names with sounds, images, emotions; massively improves your recall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;images-are-powerful&quot;&gt;Images are powerful&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;People that learn quickly or have a so - called photographic memory apply creativity to everything they learn.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When you see information as an image in your mind, you can jump in and out of it; this improves your understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;neuroscientist John Medina said, “Hear a piece of information and three days later you’ll remember 10 percent of it. Add a picture and you’ll remember 65 percent. ”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The SEE Principle
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;S — Senses&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;E — Exaggeration&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;E — Energize: Give your mental pictures action. Would you rather watch a movie of your holiday or a slide show? What creates more feeling in your imagination: a horse standing still or a horse that is running and moving?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The greatest secret to having a powerful memory is bringing information to life with your endless imagination.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Organizing new information is key to retention and retrieval.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;use-your-car-or-body-to-remember&quot;&gt;Use your car or body to remember&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The car list works because your whole car is in your long - term memory (LTM). LTM offers you a place to store the new information; that is, the locations in the car become “ storage compartments ” for short - term memories (STMs). All the memory methods in this book work with this formula: LTM + STM = MTM&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The body method was originally invented by the ancient Greeks. You can use it to remember information for exams, work, shopping, or any list of items.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;remembering-numbers&quot;&gt;Remembering numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The “ shape peg ” method was developed in 1651 by Henry Herdson, who linked numbers to objects shaped like the digits. The “rhyming peg ” method was introduced two centuries later by John Sambrook in 1879.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Rhyming Pegs - eg 1 = fun&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The 10 emotions of power help you remember. Use one of them with a peg.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The 10 emotions of power are: Love and warmth Appreciation and gratitude Curiosity Excitement and passion Determination Flexibility Confidence Cheerfulness Vitality Contribution&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shape Pegs The second peg method, the shape system, converts numbers into concrete shapes. It works in the same way as the rhyming peg method, only this time the pegs are shaped like the number.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;linking-thoughts&quot;&gt;Linking Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can remember all 45 presidents just by linking one thought to the next. If you have any problems recalling the list, just make it more detailed and make the links clearer. Here is the list of the first 12 presidents: George Washington: washing a tin.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;remembering-names&quot;&gt;Remembering Names&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language”. — Dale Carnegie&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Concentrate
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;the first thing you have to do is take control of the introduction so you can slow it down. Next, pay attention and really listen to the name, because if you don’t hear it you will not remember it. As Oliver Wendel Holmes said, “ A person must get a thing before they can forget it. ” If you hear the name, repeat it back to the person ; this will improve your recall. If you don’t hear the name, ask the person to say it again. If it is a difficult name, ask them to spell it, too. Listen and be genuinely interested in the other person’s name.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Create
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Create an image for the name in your mind so you can recreate it later.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Connect
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Remember that all learning is creating relationships between the known and the unknown. When you’re introduced to someone, you see ( know ) their face — an image — so you need to connect their unknown name to their known face. When you see their face again it must act as a trigger or peg to bring the name to your awareness. Here are some methods to make the connection. All the methods listed here take a great deal longer to explain than to use. Comparison Connection With this method, you connect the person to a name that you already know.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Face Connection&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;With this method, you make a link between the name and an outstanding feature in the person’s appearance. Every face is unique and every face has an outstanding feature.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Meeting Location Connection&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Continuous Use
 	- If you concentrate, get the name, make it meaningful, and connect it to the person, you will remember it for the short term. To make the name stick in your long - term memory, however, you have to continue using it. Talk about their name. If it is a foreign name ask the person what it means. How do they spell it? Also, use their name in conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;presenting-from-memory&quot;&gt;Presenting from Memory&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Great presenters know that audiences tend to remember:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;F — First things&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;L — Last things&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;O — Outstanding information&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;O — Own links&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;R — Repeated information&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Therefore, they make their introductions and conclusions powerful and outstanding. They open with memorable demonstrations, questions, facts, quotations, or meaningful stories. They also continually link information to the audience, make it more outstanding, and repeat the main points. If you design your presentation with the FLOOR principle in mind, your audience will remember more — and your presentation will be more enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Happiness in this life can be achieved by focusing on the natural and essential (which everything we truly need in life is - eg. food, water); and meaningful friendships.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To avoid extravagance and reduce desire is to pursue simplicity and what is natural. Just as the subtraction of evil leaves only the good. Pursuit of wealth and doing wrong lead only to fear and suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Live simply. Seek and provide friendship. Enjoy the present. Welcome tomorrow but do not seek it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-happy-life-letter-to-menoeceus&quot;&gt;The Happy Life (letter to Menoeceus)&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The major elements of the letter are:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The Gods are blessed but are of no concern to us&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;There is nothing to fear in death
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;“all good an evil lies in sensation, and death ends all sensation”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Blessed is a pain free body and a tranquil mind&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Pleasure is the guide in all we choose
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;“given that pleasure is the primary and natural good, we do not choose every and any pleasure, but often pass by many if they are outweighed by the discomforts they bring”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Live Simply
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;“all that is natural is easy to get, while that which is superfluous is hard.”&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;“Moreover [simple things] fit us to be unafraid of fortune.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Live with an eye to the consequences
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;“it is impossible to live pleasurably without living prudently”.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are the quotes that stood out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Of all the means which are procured by wisdom to ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is the acquisition of friends”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“For most men rest is stagnation and activity madness.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“No one when he sees evil deliberately chooses it, but is enticed by it as being good in comparison with a greater evil and so pursues it.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“It is not the young man who should be thought happy, but an old man who has lived a good life. For the young man at the height of his powers is unstable and is carried this way and that by fortune, like a headlong stream. But the old man has come to anchor in old-age as though in port, and the good things for which before he hardly hoped he has brought into safe harbourage in his grateful recollections.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“The veneration of the wise man is a great blessing to those who venerate him”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“It is not so much our friend’s help that helps us as the confidence of their help.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“We should not spoil what we have by desiring what we have not, but remember that what we do have is the gift of fortune.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“The greatest blessing is created and enjoyed at the same moment”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“We must release ourselves from the prison of affairs and politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Frugality too has a limit, and the man who disregards it is in like case with him who errs through excess.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Praise from others must come unasked: we must concern ourselves with the healing of our own lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“A free life cannot acquire many possessions, because this is not easy to do without servility to mobs or monarchs, yet it possesses all things in unfailing abundance; and if by chance it obtains many possessions, it is easy to distribute them so as to win the gratitude of neighbours.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Nothing is sufficient for him to whom what is sufficient seems little”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Let nothing be done in your life, which will cause you fear if it becomes known to your neighbour.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Every desire must be confronted with this question; what will happen to me, if the object of my desire is accomplished and what if it is not?”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“The greatest fruit of self-sufficiency is freedom”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Sexual intercourse has never done a man good, and he is lucky if it has not harmed him.”  - can’t say that I agree with this (!) such a strange saying that it’s worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Vain is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man. For just as there is no profit in medicine if it does not expel the diseases of the body, so there is no profit in philosophy either, if it does not expel the suffering of the mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“He who least needs to-morrow, will most gladly go to meet to-morrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“The laws exist for the sake of the wise, not that they may not do wrong, but that they may not suffer it.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“A man who causes fear cannot be free from fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“The wise man is little inconvenienced by fortune: things that matter are under the control of his own judgement and reason. No greater pleasure could be derived from an eternal life than is actually derived from the existence we can see to be infinite.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“The fool’s life is ungracious and fearful: it is directed totally at the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinions, you will never be rich.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“For many, the acquisition of riches has not made an end of troubles, but an alteration.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Ungoverned anger begets madness.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Before you eat and drink anything, consider carefully who you eat and drink it with: feeding without a friend is the life of a lion or a wolf.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“If you wish to make Pythocles rich, be not adding to do his money but subtracting from his desires.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“No one parts from life in a state any different from that in which he entered it…No one parts from life any different from how he was born.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“For the guilty to remain hidden is possible; to be confident in such concealment is impossible.” [Seneca’s gloss is “Good fortune frees many men from punishment, but none from the fear of it.”]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;

It’s been defined by the Agile Coaching Institute, but also frequently interpreted and modified by organisations and practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you call any difference a “context specific improvement” or “corruption” depends on whether it fits or contradicts Agile, progressive principles. Certainly some Agile Coach interpretations do, but otherwise looking at the context and not sticking with a rigid dictate of what something is and how it should be done is the very essence of agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I present my view on what the role is and what great looks like. It’s shaped by my experience and what I’ve learned over the years; I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t work. I’ve been a Scrum Master 5 years, interviewed, hired and managed a team of Scrum Masters, hired and led a team of Agile Coaches in a transformation; working as an Agile Coach at team and leadership levels in a major telco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done right the role is a powerful catalyst for change and improvement. Done badly it can be ineffective and even detrimental - like a doctor prescribing the wrong medicine to a patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-an-agile-coach-do&quot;&gt;What does an Agile Coach do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a high level description of the role; it supports an organisation, its teams and people in their adoption of Agile values (or similar modern values related to people, flow, improvement and customer focus). It encourages experimentation with new ways of working, empiricism and adoption of new behaviours promoting flow, continuous improvement, quality communication and improved customer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “Coach” is misleading, since it’s only a facet of the role. The Agile Coaching Institute uses “Practitioner”, but it seems that “Coach” has stuck. As the below image shows, taken from their website, other expected skills are teaching, mentoring, technical mastery, business mastery, transformation mastery and facilitation. Individuals will bring their own skills and be stronger in some areas than others. That’s what makes diversity great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Agile-Coach-Competency-Framework-for-website.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Agile Coach competency framework&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the word “Agile” is limiting. The ACI has included “Lean”, however personally I’ve sought individuals with a wider skillset, which I also strive to develop myself. Communication skills expertise, Liberating Structures, Systems thinking and a number of other tools and techniques can be useful. Look at what the organisation wants to achieve, then establish the skills you need. Like the old adage; if you only bring a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another diagram that’s useful is the one below. It’s a modification of a much older diagram on “the consulting role”. This modification works for our case (credit to Dandy People who created it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every business and context is different, every team is at a different stage in their journey. A great Agile Coach selects the appropriate stance for the context and will modify this over time. Usually in a way that gives individuals the capability and confidence to no longer need the support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/choosing-coaching-stance-graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;choosing a coaching stance&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Agile Coach works at one, or all of three levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team level:&lt;/strong&gt; supporting a number of teams of “doers” carrying out work on a product. This would involve observation and coaching of the team or individuals. The “why” behind suggestions and techniques to try to solve a particular problem. Training of the team in roles, techniques and events. “Showing by example” - hands on mentoring or training of individuals by facilitating events or working through activities (eg helping a new Product Owner on managing a backlog). If a team isn’t doing Scrum but has a dedicated individual to support them with ways of working expertise and Agile, then they’re generally called an Agile Coach to be non Scrum specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team of teams level:&lt;/strong&gt; supporting a team of teams of a particular value stream, product or programme. The principle difference between this and team level is a focus on handoff points and dependencies between teams. Using Agile approaches to minimise or improve these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise level:&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes called “Enterprise Coaches”. These individuals will work with senior managers and business leaders. Helping them understand the “why” behind certain Agile concepts, and how they can be implemented. Think organisational design, creating an environment supportive of the Agile principles, policies etc. I should add that I find creating a hierarchy of Agile Coaches unhelpful. A great Agile Coach should work at all levels from time to time in order to keep their skills sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-difference-between-an-agile-coach-and-a-scrum-master&quot;&gt;The difference between an Agile Coach and a Scrum Master&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear. An Agile Coach is not necessarily more advanced or a step up from a Scrum Master. Many assume it is because they generally work at a higher level and earn more. I’ve known Scrum Masters that are more knowledgeable and capable than someone calling themself an Agile Coach, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re hiring an Agile Coach, you should expect a broader experience with various ways of working techniques. One may be Scrum but they should be framework agnostic. That’s not to say there aren’t a lot of great Scrum Masters out there that apply much more than Scrum and XP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-the-agile-coach-role-important&quot;&gt;Why is the Agile Coach role important?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve got a problem to solve. The old ways of doing things aren’t working, or are leaving you behind the competition. You’re bringing on Agile Coaches to help the organisation towards Agile values and ways of working. If this is successful you will see happier people, working in an environment where they can raise issues and see the value they’re producing; improved business outcomes, from increased customer focus and connection; a more effective organisation through improved feedback, shorter lead times (a true measure of agility) and accelerated innovation with a culture of continuous improvement. That’s why the role is important - but only if it can fix your problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-whats-the-future-of-the-role&quot;&gt;So what’s the future of the role?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prediction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile Coaches will still be called such when helping businesses to roll out specific Agile frameworks, or working with teams using Agile, eg XP and Scrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly we’ll see a role that isn’t specifically related to Agile, or confused by the word “coach”. Something along the lines of “Ways of working specialist” or “agility practitioner: (as mentioned the ACI already uses Agile Practitioner). This is probably closer to what I’ve intended for the role when I’ve hired Agile Coaches, something broader.

It’s well argued and I can relate personally. I’ve found work I’m passionate about, but as a student I’d not even heard of my industry. Following your passion sounds great, but that assumes you know your passion, and that following it will provide you with a successful and meaningful career (there are examples in the book to illustrate how it can lead you astray). For me the work, skills and purpose came over time. There are definitely exceptions (sports being one), but for many it’s great advice; get out there and start working to discover your passion and earn options to pursue it. One of the best career advice books I’ve read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-big-idea-what-so-what-now-what&quot;&gt;The big idea. What, so what, now what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To get work you love, following your passion is bad advice. First, you need to &lt;strong&gt;develop rare skills and experience&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives you &lt;strong&gt;control&lt;/strong&gt;. It makes you valuable. With control you can get more &lt;strong&gt;autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;. You can negotiate. You have options. This allows you to pursue a mission. Providing you with &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. Working at the cutting edge of a field is where you usually find it - to get there you must build skills, experience and value. A compelling mission should be &lt;strong&gt;remarkable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This means rather than dreaming up a passion and pursuing it (except in some situations, like sports), you should focus on developing valuable skills and following the route I’ve described. These can be in an areas you’re interested in. But as the examples show, you may be surprised and find out it’s not so great. Developing skills and experience will take you on a journey that will lead you to your passion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick a field that appeals. Work hard, develop rare skills. Pursue the options that interest you as they begin to emerge. You’ll start to arrive at the cutting edge, where the interesting work is. This will take you to your purpose and true fulfilment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-follow-your-passion&quot;&gt;Don’t follow your passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Steve jobs didn’t follow his passion. He got a lucky break from a small time scheme that eventually paid off. His passion was Buddhism, natural retreats and spiritualism. Electronics was a way to make money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career passions are rare&lt;/strong&gt;
      - top 5 identified passions for students were dance, hockey, skiing, reading and swimming. These don’t have much to offer when it comes to choosing a job.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion takes time&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;in studies of collage administrative assistants, the more experience an assistant had, the more likely she was to love her work.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;if you’ve had many year’s experience then you’ve had time to get better at what you do and develop a feeling of efficacy. It gives you more time to build relationships and see your work benefit others.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion is a side effect of mastery&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Self determination theory (SDT). Three basic needs to feel intrinsically motivated at work.
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Autonomy; the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Competence; the feeling that you are good at what you do. (mastery in Daniel Pink’s book Drive)&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Relatedness; the feeling of connection to other people.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The assistants build the three of these areas over time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working right trumps finding the right work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following your passion is chasing an elusive dream.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Following your passion doesn’t make you happy. Keeping options open, taking opportunities, doing great work - you build passion in what you do.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace the passion mindset (what value your jobs gives you) with &lt;strong&gt;the craftsman mindset&lt;/strong&gt; (what value you’re producing in your job)
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;“Be so good they can’t ignore you” - Steve Martin’s philosophy for success. Develop so much experience that you can’t help but succeed. You get confidence in pushing the envelope.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-skill&quot;&gt;The importance of &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The traits that make a great job are rare and valuable. Therefore, if you want a great job you have to build up rare and valuable skills.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Cal calls these skills your “career capital”.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Examples include Steve Martin, Steve Jobs, Ira Glass (radio), Merrick (surfboard). All worked hard building skills and ended up in dream jobs because of that.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;This means a craftsman’s mindset. But there are 3 disqualifiers:
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;The job focuses on something you think is useless or bad for the work (ie tax consultant).&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Examples of people building career capital;
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;a debater becomes assistant, becomes staff writer, becomes producer. Honing craft, writing in the evening, seeking frequent feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;a biologist works on an energy project for his professor, becomes energy entrepreneur, meets vc and gets clean energy role from introduction, ending up as the clean energy vc.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliberate practice is needed&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;10,000 hour rule. If you just show up and work hard, you’ll plateu.
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Deliberate practice is “activity designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance”.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 habits to a craftsman&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Identify the market you’re in (2 types)
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Winner takes all markets (blogging, script writing) are all about one specific skill you have to optimise relentlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Auction markets are less structured. A collection of various skills can help you succeed. (venture capitalist). There is more flexibility. If doors open, you can take the opportunity and build capital.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Identify your capital type
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;As above. For auction you can go for open doors. For Winner, you know what it must be.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Define good
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;You need clear goals&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Stretch and destroy
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Get uncomfortable.
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                      &lt;li&gt;“Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable.” It takes focus and concentration. If you’re not uncomfortable then you’re probably stuck at an acceptable level.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Embrace honest feedback.
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                      &lt;li&gt;Even if it destroys what you thought was good.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;Be patient.
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                      &lt;li&gt;Steve Martin thought, when taking up the banjo, that if he stuck to it then one day he’ll have been playing for 40 years. And someone whose been playing for 40 years will be pretty good at it.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;control-is-important-or-turn-down-the-promotion&quot;&gt;Control is important (or turn down the promotion)&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Control over what you do and how you do it is one of the most powerful traits you can acquire when creating the work you love.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You gain control by investing your career capital. It’s a great investment.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Example of a guy that built a lot of capital in farming. He invested it in setting up a farm.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;ROWE (results only work environment) - reportedly highly rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement and sense of fulfilment.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control that’s acquired without career capital isn’t sustainable.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;In other words, if you don’t have the skills and experience that makes you valuable, and can be exchanged for control, you don’t have any real leverage for the control.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you have the career capital to get control over your working life, you’ll be so valuable that your current employer will seek to prevent you making the change.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Example of a software developer, Lulu. She build strong skills, used it to take time off etc. Had to deal with aggressive counter offers and show courage choosing other options (eg freelance.)&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The key is knowing when it’s right to be courageous in your career decisions. Calculated, rather than the “follow your passion” kind.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid the traps with the law of financial viability&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do what people are willing to pay for&lt;/strong&gt; - Derek Sivers&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;When deciding to pursue something that will give more control over your work life, seek evidence that people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-mission&quot;&gt;The importance of mission&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To have a mission is to have a unifying focus for your career.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A mission chosen before you have relevant career capital is not likely to be sustainable. Missions emerge.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Good career missions are found in the Adjacent possible - you have to get to the cutting edge in order to find your mission, this take time and requires you to develop skill first.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&quot;”Term from science writer Steven Johnson, who took it from Stuart Kauffman, that helps explain the origin of innovation. Johnson notes that the next big ideas in any field are typically found right beyond the cutting edge, in the adjacent space that contains the possible new combinations of existing ideas. The key observation is that you have to get to the cutting edge of a field before it’s adjacent possible - and the innovations it contains -becomes visible.” -from So good they can’t ignore you p236 #innovation #creativity”&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Advancing to the cutting edge in a field means you have to focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Example of a biologist with a great mission, using computational genetics to understand and fight ancient diseases. First focussed for years on a narrow niche - the genetics of diseases in Africa.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Great missions are transformed into great successes through small, achievable projects - little bets - to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding an idea.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;References a book - &lt;strong&gt;Little Bets&lt;/strong&gt; by Peter Sims&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missions require marketing&lt;/strong&gt;; they must be remarkable
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Law of remarkability: A mission driven project should compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;References Seth Godin’s book Purple Cow. “The world is full of boring stuff - brown cows - which is why so few people pay attention…A purple cow… now that would stand out. Remarkable marketing is the art of building things worth noticing.”&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;cals-routines&quot;&gt;Cal’s routines&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Research bible
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Once a week he summarises in his “bible” a paper he thinks might be relevant to his research. Description of the result, how it compares to previous work, main strategies to obtain it.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Introduces the strain of deliberate practice.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hour tally routine
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Tallies the total number of hours he’s spent each month in deliberate practice.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Theory notebook routine
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Fancy notebook, to remind him it’s important. Brainstorming of new theory results. Formally recorded on a dated page. More deliberate practice.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working right trumps finding the right work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
