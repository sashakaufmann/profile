&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vast Russian privatizations post communism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vouchers issued to citizens, bought up in exchanges and used to purchase shares of Russian companies at very low rates (how he starts to make money with his hedge fund).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many state companies valued way below comparative companies inside and outside Russia. Easily calculable value discrepancies based on assets alone, for example barrels of oil. Massive opportunity for those that could spot this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prison yard attitude in Russia. Show no weakness more important than rationality. Especially for an oligarch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1998 Russia goes into financial meltdown - his fund looses 90% from 1b to 100m.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quotes
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Seventy years of communism had destroyed the work ethic of an entire nation. Millions of Russians had been sent to the gulags for showing the slightest hint of personal initiative. The Soviets severely penalized independent thinkers, so the natural self-preservation reaction was to do as little as possible and hope that nobody would notice you.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“The less people know about how sausages and laws are made, the better they sleep at night.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“After Khodorkovsky was found guilty, most of Russia’s oligarchs went one by one to Putin and said, ‘Vladimir Vladimirovich, what can I do to make sure I won’t end up sitting in a cage?’ I wasn’t there, so I’m only speculating, but I imagine Putin’s response was something like this: ‘Fifty per cent.”&lt;/li&gt;

It’s very readable and I’d highly recommend getting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOC is a methodology for identifying the most important constraint standing in the way of achieving a goal (aka bottleneck); then systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-five-focussing-steps&quot;&gt;The five focussing steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the system’s constraint(s).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decide how to exploit the system’s constraint(s).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subordinate everything else to the above decision(s).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alleviate the system’s constraint(s).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Warning! If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system’s constraint. In other words, don’t stop!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Gain agreement on the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gain agreement on the direction for a solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gain agreement that the solution solves the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agree to overcome any potential negative ramifications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agree to overcome any obstacles to implementation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked. If you want to build a complex system that works, build a simpler system first, and then improve it over time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure”&lt;/i&gt; — Melvin E. Conway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software interface structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organisations that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. Small distributed teams more likely to produce more modular service architecture. Large colocated teams more likely to produce monolithic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what? Communication paths and interaction between teams matter. Org structure matters. Conway’s law is more of a heuristic than a scientific principle, but it’s absolutely logical. Communication is the principle thing happening in organisations, and design will follow the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sash</name></author><category term="complexity" /><summary type="html">Heuristic for systems design.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kaufie.com/resources-assets/conways-law.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kaufie.com/resources-assets/conways-law.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Cynefin</title><link href="https://kaufie.com/cynefin" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cynefin" /><published>2021-04-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-04-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://kaufie.com/cynefin</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kaufie.com/cynefin">&lt;p&gt;Above image is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cognitive-edge.com/the-cynefin-framework/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Cynefin framework by David Snowden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They come with experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience give you a frame of reference for theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned the most in areas that I was thrown into earlier in my career, before I knew what good looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wondering why it’s so powerful a learning experience to do something first and learn about it on the job, applying new knowledge (theory) afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt the power of this is being able to bring to mind examples that relate to what you’re learning. But I think it’s deeper than that. You’re not limiting yourself to looking through the prism of theory only. You’re using it to illuminate a much broader experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use an analogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience is like knowing the terrain of an island.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know every nook and cranny. But you don’t know where the treasure is buried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find it by trial and error. You may work out the hard way where the quicksand is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lead-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/article-assets/a-experience-white-bg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;experience is like an island&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theory is like learning where the treasure is buried.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know where to look, but first you have to get to the spot. You’re not prepared for that. You’ve never seen quicksand before…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably get there eventually. But it’s going to be hard. In theory it was straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lead-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/article-assets/a-theory-white-bg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;theory is the route&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you know the terrain well, you can apply the theory well. It will fit into place, you know what to expect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, a great example was in leadership. It wasn’t something I’d aimed for or given much thought to, I emulated the leaders around me, I had successes and I made mistakes. I saw, experienced and partook in the good and the bad. Having built and led teams, when I dig into books like &lt;a href=&quot;/extreme-ownership-by-jocko-willink&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Extreme Ownership&lt;/a&gt;
they really hit home. I recall what I did well but more often than not see what I could have done better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying the knowledge to past experience brings deep learning and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sash</name></author><category term="improvement" /><category term="learning" /><category term="improvement" /><summary type="html">You learn from the bruises.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-idealist&quot;&gt;The idealist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After losing his job, having not made his dreams a reality “… idealism was gone from the stage.  In its place was an understanding that ideas – dreams – were useless without power to transform them into reality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-reformer&quot;&gt;The reformer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working to reform the civil service, encounters subversive but not open opposition from the authorities. Delay tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rise-to-power&quot;&gt;Rise to power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving from being theoretical (forward thinking ideas) to practical (getting things done, compromise). Under Mrs Moskowitz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationship with Al Smith, another remarkable character. Coming from poverty, becoming a champion of reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He became a creature of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misleading and underestimating, in fact, might be the only way to get a project started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems Thinking example. Moses’ bridges were intended to alleviate traffic problems but saw increased traffic and led to new congestion. New bridges were built but it continued to get worse. p519.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By dumping a tremendous new load on the long island parkways, the Bronx Whitestone bridge made the traffic tie-ups on the noticeably worse.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One must wait until the evening, to see how beautiful the day has been” - Sophocles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As long as you’re on the side of parks, you’re on the side of the angels. You can’t lose.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once you sync that first stake, they’ll never make you pull it up“.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hospitality has always been a potent political weapon. Moses used it like a master. Coupled with his overpowering personality, a buffet often did as much for a proposal as a bribe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Science, knowledge, logic and brilliance might be useful tools but they didn’t build highways or civil service systems. Power built highways and civil service systems. Power was what dreams needed, not power in the hand of the dreamer himself necessarily but power put behind the dreamer’s dream by the man who it to put there, power that he termed “executive support”.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used in Albany “You can get an awful lot done in the world if you’re willing to let someone else take the credit for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Politics is a thieves game. Those who stay in it long enough are invariably robbed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bob Moses had learned what was needed to make dreams become realities. He had learned the lesson of power. And now he grabbed for power with both hands. To free his hands for the grab, he shook impatiently from them the last crumbs of the principles with which he had entered public service and for which, during his years of idealism, he had fought so hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…his success in public relations had been due primarily to his masterful utilization of a single public relations technique: identifying himself with a popular cause. This technique was especially advantageous to him because his philosophy–that accomplishment, Getting Things Done, is the only thing that matters, that the end justifies any means, however ruthless–might not be universally popular. By keeping the public eye focused on the cause, the end, the ultimate benefit to be obtained, the technique kept the public eye from focusing on the methods by which the method was to be obtained.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes" /><category term="politics" /><category term="biography" /><summary type="html">How the unelected Robert Moses built an empire of public authorities that gave him the power to defy Mayors, Governors and a President.
