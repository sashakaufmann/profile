Voltaire challenges the beliefs of Leibnitzian optimism and determinism, religion and the many churches of the time.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candide is an innocent, naive chap who suffers many (many!) misfortunes whilst trying to reunite with his love, Cunégonde. He and other characters suffer floggings, beatings, sacking, rape, mutilation, inquisitors, selfishness, and thieving. Through all this suffering and injustice he very slowly comes to understand (barely) the ridiculousness of the view ingrained in him by his philosopher teacher Pangloss that all is for the best in the world and everything is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still relevant to our times and never boring this rightly lives on as a classic. Aside from its attacks and satire, the morale is summed up near the end. The Turk states “Work keeps us from three great evils: boredom, vice, and need”. “We must cultivate our garden”. I take this to mean that work and conscious effort is needed to live well; in contrast to the Leibnitzian view of things being as they are for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;micromégas&quot;&gt;Micromégas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A philosophical tale about a giant being visiting our planet, who hears of the deeds men do to one another for a few small lumps of earth. “…deep down he was a trifle vexed to see that being so infinitesimally small should have a degree of pride that was almost infinitely great.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zadig&quot;&gt;Zadig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An asian tale of a clever, virtuous and courageous man who benefits from his attributes but also suffers for them. “ in this world things did not always turn out the way wisemen wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-white-bull&quot;&gt;The White Bull&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story of the Middle east based on the Greek mythological tale of Europa and the bull (where the white bull is the king of the Greek gods, Zeus, in disguise). A princess encounters an old woman with a beautiful white bull and other animals from scripture (the serpent, doves, a whale). It is in fact her love, a prince. She is entranced by it but her father wishes to have it sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Candide
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Philosophy (Leibnitzian). Everything works out for the best. Everything happens for a reason.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The nose is there for spectacles. Legs are created to wear trousers.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Dr Pangloss - “Individual misfortunes contribute to the general good with the result that the more individual misfortunes there are, the more all is well.”&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The bad things that happen to Candide he thinks good and inevitable once a good end is obtained.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Characters have little agency. When the good Anabaptist is drowning; it’s fine, thats why the harbour is there.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;“It is impossible for things not to be where they are. For all is well.”&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Harsh world. Floggings, beatings, sacking, rape, inquisitors, selfishness, theiving.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Candide-“If this is the best of all possible worlds what must the others be like?“; he’d just had a flogging and seen his mentor being hanged by the inquisitors.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Encounters a sugar processing slave in Surinam with a missing hand and foot. Suffering so that the Europeans can enjoy their sugar. Not unlike the third world today.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;After escaping the inquisitors in Portugal travels to Argentina, then Paraguay. Finds and kills Cunegonde’s brother a Jesuit, encounters natives, El Dorado, the pirate, return voyage to Venice.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No-one is happy on closer inspection- the Theatine monk and Paquette. Even the Venetian nobleman who has everything is unhappy with it - bored. Only in the mythical land of El Dorado, which is unattainable, are people truly happy.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Yet eventually he finds and frees Cunégonde and lives on a farm with his small group. There they are bored and miserable.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Old woman: “I would like to know which is worse: being raped 100 times by negro pirates, having a buttock chopped off, running the gauntlet of the Bulgars, being flogged and hanged in an auto-da-fé, being dissected, rowing in a galley, in short suffering all the misfortunes we all suffered, or simply being stuck here and doing nothing? “That is a good question”, said Candide. This speech gave rise to renewed speculation, and Martin in particular came to the conclusion that man was born to spend his life ultimately a pray to the throes of anxiety and the lethargy of boredom.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Morals at the end:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The Turk: ‘Work keeps us from three great evils: boredom, vice, and need.”&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;“We must cultivate our garden” - you make the best of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zadig
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“..self-esteem is a balloon filled with wind, from which great tempests surge when it is pricked.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hermes the doctor says Zadig will loose an eye. All Babylon marvelled at the depth of his knowledge…but it is cured. He writes a book proving it shouldn’t have got better. Zadig didn’t read it. = Iatrogenics&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Zadig is desperately trying to be happy.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“It is to Zadig that nations owe the great principle that it is better to risk sparing a guilty man than it is to condemn an innocent one.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Woman who will throw herself on the funeral pyre: “..one has to do the done thing.” - compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;After getting his armour and emblem robbed, and his chances of becoming king of Babylon ruined by the cowardly Itobad, Zadig says there it is; ‘education, virtue, courage: they brought me nothing but disaster’.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It was agreed in the course of conversation that in this world things did not always turn out the way wisemen wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Ingenu
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A foreigner in Brittany. Speaks to the ridiculousness of organised religion. The rules of men vs God. The Ingenu breaks and questions them. Eg why not marrying his godmother. Nothing in the scriptures.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For having learnt nothing at all in his childhood, he had not acquired any prejudices.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Iatrogenics the cause of the Ingenu’s love Saint-Yves’ death.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make work visible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Limit work-in-progress (WIP).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measure and manage the flow of work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prioritise effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make adjustments based on lessons from feedback and metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-5-thieves-of-time&quot;&gt;The 5 thieves of time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too much work in progress (WIP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unknown dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplanned work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conflicting priorities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neglected work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-expose-time-theft-to-optimise-workflow&quot;&gt;How to expose time theft to optimise workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make work visible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make WIP visible and limit it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expose dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplanned work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prioritise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prevent negligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flow-metrics&quot;&gt;Flow metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flow time: a measure of how long something took to do from beginning to end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cycle time: ambiguous - different meanings depending on who you ask.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WIP is a leading indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Little’s Law assumptions
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All measure units are consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Average arrival rate = average departure rate.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All work that enters the system flows to competion and exists.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Average age of WIP is neither increasing or decreasing.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The total amount of WIP is roughly the same at the beginning and at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Queuing Theory
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There’s a direct correlation between WIP and capacity utilization.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unpredictable events cause variability. The more variability, the more vulnerable we are to capacity overload.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The single biggest factor that affects queue size is capacity utilization.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kingman’s formula shows an approximation for the average wait time in a queue.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As we move from 60%-80% utilization, the queue doubles. As we move from 80%-90% it doubles again.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finding-out-where-waste-is-emerging&quot;&gt;Finding out where waste is emerging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider measuring:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unplanned work&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unknown dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Conflicting priorities&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Neglacted work&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reporting
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Aging reports&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Card type distribution&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Failure load (value demand vs failure demand)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flow efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

It’s the skill with which you do something. To refine it you need to learn what you’re doing right, but more crucially what you’re doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do weights, the heavier you go, the clearer the feedback you get on bad technique; you get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a healthy fear the first time I lifted a 24kg kettlebell. The kind you feel to stop yourself from doing something stupid. I could tell that if I held it in the wrong way, or moved badly it could snap my arm like a twig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do what’s called the Turkish get-up. You start off laid on your back, lift the kettlebell up overhead and in a series of movements stand up and then in reverse lie back down. Every time I used it I’d concentrate on the way I held it, where the weight was positioned and how I moved with it. The more muscle I built, the easier it became and the less my technique mattered. I’d concentrate less and take it in my stride. When I got the 32kg I again felt a good, healthy kind of fear. Less than the first time, but it was there all the same. But I’d got used to focussing on muscle over technique, so when I lifted it overhead I damaged my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I now realise that I was lifting it wrongly; pulling it instead of bringing it first to my chest and pushing it up. What I’d done before worked for the 24, but it was only by moving up to the 32 that I really learned something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is; the further past your comfort zone you go, the more powerful the feedback, because the more technique matters. It’s clear with weights, because the price is high and tangible (physically paid in pain). The principle is also true of other sports, activities and things in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trainer or coach can help improve technique without you having to go through that pain. With weights thats probably the smart way of doing it. In general though nothing helps you grow and learn more than first hand experience. It’s the pain, physical or psychological, that makes you change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reminder: push beyond your comfort zone to significantly improve. But make sure your technique is “good enough” to take the real or metaphorical weight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sash</name></author><category term="life" /><category term="technique" /><category term="skill" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html">Push beyond your comfort zone without getting hurt.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kaufie.com/kettlebell.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kaufie.com/kettlebell.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</title><link href="https://kaufie.com/hard-boiled-wonderland-and-the-end-of-the-world-by-haruki-murakami" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World" /><published>2020-12-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kaufie.com/hard-boiled-wonderland-and-the-end-of-the-world-by-haruki-murakami</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kaufie.com/hard-boiled-wonderland-and-the-end-of-the-world-by-haruki-murakami">&lt;p&gt;This book delivers on a number of things you’d expect from Murakami; it’s surreal, has tonnes of references to 60/70/80s pop culture, plus detailed descriptions of cooking and characters getting on with life.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deep rivers run quiet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love these descriptions of food (goes on for a few pages). “While I waited for her, I fixed supper. I mashed an umeboshi salt plum with mortar and pestle to make a sour-sweet dressing; I fried up a few sardines with abura-agé tofu-puffs in grated yama-imo taro batter; I sautéed a celery-beef side dish. Not a bad little meal.” p89&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Histories within stories. Characters reading books in a book. The discovery of a unicorn skull in Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re thinking of when you met your partner. Your kids. Starting a business. Lifelong friends. A career you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that some of these things were planned out. Others were the direct or indirect result of being in the right place, at the right time and of the decisions you made in the moment. Most of the time you only know that it’s the right place when you’re there. You can’t plan for it, which is why seeing every situation as having the potential for something amazing to happen and maximising that chance is a far better strategy than planning life out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two approaches to life that aren’t mutually exclusive: We can focus on creating a plan, on drawing a map. We can also work on building the skills to get over the fact that we don’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a map give you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clarity of where to go, the route.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comfort and security, you know the way and can see your progress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A way to show others where you’re going and what you’re doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your destination is specific and there’s only one route; if your journey is far and hard; if you don’t have time for any detours; then you need a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focussing on having a map means spending a lot of time planning and waiting for the right moment for something to happen. If you do that, you’ll get on the route, and you’ll probably make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can obsess over having a map. That’s a mistake; again, life is often so uncertain that we don’t even know our destination, let alone what will happen along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the other strategy: rather than focussing on the map, build the skills to navigate without one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing what’s important to you. The direction is more important than the route.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning how to explore, read signs along the way, assess situations and make fast decisions based on the information available, your gut and their &lt;a href=&quot;/bold-decisions-reversible&quot;&gt;reversibility&lt;/a&gt;. Often this means learning by doing and making mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going on detours. Finding some dead ends. Discovering the hidden gems of life off the beaten track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a map, you’re efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can handle life without a map, you’re resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an unpredictable world be the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sash</name></author><category term="life" /><category term="decisions" /><category term="development" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html">Go on detours.

&lt;p&gt;The two climbers in this book took a stupid risk and nearly paid the ultimate price. What they went through though makes for one hell of a survival story. The first third of the book is boring for someone who doesn’t climb as it takes us on their ascent.

The emotions he goes through, the guilt of Simon who cut Joe loose, the ebb and flow of determination and hopelessness that got him to camp. It’s powerful stuff.

  &lt;li&gt;Great quote:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“All men dream: but not all equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible. - &lt;i&gt;T.E.Lawrence, the seven pillars of Wisdom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I enjoy Muarkami’s writing style and this book was no exception. It’s not one of my favorites and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone looking for his best work, but for the most part I did find the stories interesting and unexpected.
