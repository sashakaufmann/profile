It’s the skill with which you do something. To refine it you need to learn what you’re doing right, but more crucially what you’re doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do weights, the heavier you go, the clearer the feedback you get on bad technique; you get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a healthy fear the first time I lifted a 24kg kettlebell. The kind you feel to stop yourself from doing something stupid. I could tell that if I held it in the wrong way, or moved badly it could snap my arm like a twig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do what’s called the Turkish get-up. You start off laid on your back, lift the kettlebell up overhead and in a series of movements stand up and then in reverse lie back down. Every time I used it I’d concentrate on the way I held it, where the weight was positioned and how I moved with it. The more muscle I built, the easier it became and the less my technique mattered. I’d concentrate less and take it in my stride. When I got the 32kg I again felt a good, healthy kind of fear. Less than the first time, but it was there all the same. But I’d got used to focussing on muscle over technique, so when I lifted it overhead I damaged my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I now realise that I was lifting it wrongly; pulling it instead of bringing it first to my chest and pushing it up. What I’d done before worked for the 24, but it was only by moving up to the 32 that I really learned something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is; the further past your comfort zone you go, the more powerful the feedback, because the more technique matters. It’s clear with weights, because the price is high and tangible (physically paid in pain). The principle is also true of other sports, activities and things in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trainer or coach can help improve technique without you having to go through that pain. With weights thats probably the smart way of doing it. In general though nothing helps you grow and learn more than first hand experience. It’s the pain, physical or psychological, that makes you change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reminder: push beyond your comfort zone to significantly improve. But make sure your technique is “good enough” to take the real or metaphorical weight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sash</name></author><category term="life" /><category term="technique" /><category term="skill" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html">Push beyond your comfort zone without getting hurt.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kaufie.com/kettlebell.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kaufie.com/kettlebell.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Into Thin Air</title><link href="https://kaufie.com/into-thin-air-by-jon-krakauer" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Into Thin Air" /><published>2021-01-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kaufie.com/into-thin-air-by-jon-krakauer</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kaufie.com/into-thin-air-by-jon-krakauer">&lt;p&gt;This is an account of the 1996 Everest disaster by a journalist who was with one of the groups.

  &lt;li&gt;Deep rivers run quiet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love these descriptions of food (goes on for a few pages). “While I waited for her, I fixed supper. I mashed an umeboshi salt plum with mortar and pestle to make a sour-sweet dressing; I fried up a few sardines with abura-agé tofu-puffs in grated yama-imo taro batter; I sautéed a celery-beef side dish. Not a bad little meal.” p89&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Histories within stories. Characters reading books in a book. The discovery of a unicorn skull in Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re thinking of when you met your partner. Your kids. Starting a business. Lifelong friends. A career you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that some of these things were planned out. Others were the direct or indirect result of being in the right place, at the right time and of the decisions you made in the moment. Most of the time you only know that it’s the right place when you’re there. You can’t plan for it, which is why seeing every situation as having the potential for something amazing to happen and maximising that chance is a far better strategy than planning life out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two approaches to life that aren’t mutually exclusive: We can focus on creating a plan, on drawing a map. We can also work on building the skills to get over the fact that we don’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a map give you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clarity of where to go, the route.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comfort and security, you know the way and can see your progress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A way to show others where you’re going and what you’re doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your destination is specific and there’s only one route; if your journey is far and hard; if you don’t have time for any detours; then you need a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focussing on having a map means spending a lot of time planning and waiting for the right moment for something to happen. If you do that, you’ll get on the route, and you’ll probably make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can obsess over having a map. That’s a mistake; again, life is often so uncertain that we don’t even know our destination, let alone what will happen along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the other strategy: rather than focussing on the map, build the skills to navigate without one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing what’s important to you. The direction is more important than the route.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning how to explore, read signs along the way, assess situations and make fast decisions based on the information available, your gut and their &lt;a href=&quot;/bold-decisions-reversible&quot;&gt;reversibility&lt;/a&gt;. Often this means learning by doing and making mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going on detours. Finding some dead ends. Discovering the hidden gems of life off the beaten track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a map, you’re efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can handle life without a map, you’re resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an unpredictable world be the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sash</name></author><category term="life" /><category term="decisions" /><category term="development" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html">Go on detours.

The concept is great and I’d highly recommend this book as a way to raise awareness of the different ways of looking at problems. The book is short and it could be shorter. In practice the approach can seem infantilising, although I’m sure as de Bono claims, for some groups the method has worked wonders. For me the value is in its use on a personal level; noticing the different perspectives and using them…without annoying everyone by talking about hats.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use Parallel Thinking to arrive at faster, better decisions.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;the hats are different directions.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;at any moment everyone is looking in the same direction.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;the hats are not descriptions of people but modes of behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;everyone wears the same hat at an appointed time.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Results this provides:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;power, through focussing everyone’s energy in the same direction.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;time saving, less arguments and posturing.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;removal of ego from the equation.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;consider one thing at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The neutrality of the hats allows them to be used without embarrassment.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White hat&lt;/strong&gt;. White is neutral and objective. The White hat is concerned with objective facts and figures.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;. Red suggests anger, rage and emotions. The Red hat gives the emotional view.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black hat&lt;/strong&gt;. Black is sombre and serious. The black hat is cautious and careful. It points out the weaknesses in an idea.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow hat&lt;/strong&gt;. Yellow is sunny and positive. The yellow hat is optimistic and covers hope and positive thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green hat&lt;/strong&gt;. Green is grass, vegetation and abundant, fertile growth. The green hat indicates creativity and new ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue hat&lt;/strong&gt;. Blue is cool and is also the colour of the sky, which is above everything else. The blue hat is concerned with control, the organisation of the thinking process and the use of other hats.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The hats can be used singly to request a type of thinking. Or, the hats can be used in sequence to explore a subject or solve a problem.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue hat&lt;/strong&gt; should be used like two bookends
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Before
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;why we are here.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;what we are thinking about.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;the definition of the situation or problem.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;alternate definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;what we want to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;where we want to end up.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;the background to the thinking and.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;a plan for the sequence of hats to be used.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;After
                &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;what we have achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;design.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;solution.&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;next steps.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red hat&lt;/strong&gt; may follow to get emotions on the table - but not the boss for want of making others follow&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;In an assessment situation put the &lt;strong&gt;Yellow hat&lt;/strong&gt; before the black hat because if you can’t find much value in an idea there’s no point in proceeding further&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-hats&quot;&gt;Using the hats&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White hat&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Focus exclusively on information
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;what info do we have?&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;what do we need?&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;what’s missing?&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;what questions do we need to ask?&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;hard facts and soft, opinions and feelings (reporting someone else’s, your own is for red hat)&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;define the info that’s missing!&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Used at the beginning as background or end as assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Neutral, reports on the world.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Separates fact from extrapolation or interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;There are believed facts and checked facts. the merely believed are second class. The important point is the use to which the facts are put. Before using it for the basis of a decision we need to check it.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;We need the belief tier because the tentative, the hypothetical and provocative are essential for thinking. They provide the frameworks which move ahead of the facts.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Your own opinion isn’t permissible- you can report the opinion of someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Japanese style meetings. No one puts forward a ready-made idea. Information is offered in Whitehat fashion. The Japanese notion is that ideas emerge as seedlings, nurtured and allowed to grow into shape. in contrast with the western notion that ideas should be hammered into shape by argument.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The spectrum of [[likelihood]]may be expressed as follows: Always true. Usually true. Generally true. By and large. More often than not. About half the time. Often. Sometimes true. Occasionally true. Been known to happen. Never true. Cannot be true (contradictory).&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Who puts on the hat?
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Put on your own hat. Ask someone to put on the hat. Ask everyone to put on the white hat. Choose to answer with the hat on.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red hat&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gives you an opportunity to express feelings, emotions and intuition without any need to explain or to justify them.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Must relate to a specific idea. the thinker can’t change the idea.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Individuals should not be allowed to say “pass“ when they are asked for their Red Hat feelings. They can use terms like neutral, undecided, confused, doubtful or mixed. If feelings are defined as mixed then the facilitator may ask what goes into the mix. The purpose of the Red Hat is to express feelings as they exist not to force a judgement.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Emotions and feelings are the opposite of neutral, objective information. They’re hunches, intuitions, impressions. There is no need to justify. No need to give reasons or the basis.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If emotions and feelings aren’t permitted as inputs into the thinking process they will lurk in the background and affect all the thinking in a hidden way. Emotions, feelings, hunches and intuitions are strong and real. The Red Hat acknowledges this.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Opinions may be expressed under red, black or yellow hats. When the red hat is used, it is best to express an opinion as a feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Used for reacting and getting upset. To show that this is what I feel about this meeting. Anyone who feels the need to be emotional has a defined way of doing so. Use this as a way to find out the feelings of others without guessing; you can ask them directly to put their red hat on and give you their opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black hat&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For caution. Stop us doing something illegal, dangerous, unprofitable etc.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The basis of critical thinking. Points out when something is contradictory or inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Points out how something does not fit our resources, or policy, or strategy, or ethics, values, and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Always must be a logical basis for criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In its “design” role, the black hat points out the weaknesses in an idea so that those weaknesses can be put right.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Content and process; point out errors in thinking. Question the strength of the evidence. Does the conclusion follow? Is it the only possible conclusion?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To avoid interactions during the process the thinker should note and accumulate the main points of criticism and put them forward only when the black hat is in use.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At the end there should be a clear map of possible problems, obstacles, difficulties and dangers. These can be clarified and elaborated. Under the green hat and attempt is made to overcome or cope with the difficulties suggested under the black hat.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The past and the future. What is likely to happen in the future? Does this fit past experience? What are the risks?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The problem of overuse; it’s easy to be critical. Some people enjoy being only critical. The need to contribute.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Black hat thinking is not about arguments and must not be allowed to generate into argument. The purpose of black hat thinking is to put the caution points on the map.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow hat&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Optimism. Positive thinking. Sunshine and brightness. Focus on benefit. Constructive thinking and making things happen. The thinker sets out to find whatever benefit there might be in a decision and how to put it into practice.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Harder to use than the black hat, people naturally think of dangers.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Should be logically based.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Self interest is a strong basis for positive thinking. The yellow hat does not have to await such motivations.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Optimistic suggestions should be noted and put on the map. No reason to assess them before doing so; but worth labelling with a rough estimate of [[likelihood]]. #probability
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Proven.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Very likely, based on experience and what we know.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Good chance - through a combination of different things.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Even chance.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;No better than possible.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Remote or long shot.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Having it on the map means we have a choice.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reasons and logical support; what is your positive view based on? Why do you think it will happen this way? Background reasons for the optimism.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Constructive thinking. making things happen. Proposals and suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Speculation. Looking into the future. The value of “if”. The best possible scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Opportunity thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You start with the best possible scenario because if the benefits aren’t sufficient with that then the idea is not worth pursuing.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The speculative aspect of yellow hat thinking is also concerned with vision.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Difference between constructive and creative. Yellow hat thinking is not directly concerned with creativity which is green hat thinking. A person can be an excellent yellow hat thinker and never have a new idea. The effective application of old ideas is a proper exercise of yellow heart thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Can define an opportunity and leave it to green hat thinking to come up with some novel way of exploiting that opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green hat&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Creativity, energy, growth.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gives people that never thought of themselves as creative encouragement to start making a creative effort, increases their confidence and they therefore can contribute in a meaningful way.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It gives us possibilities. Without possibilities you cannot make progress. 2000 years ago, Chinese technology was way ahead of western technology. Then progress seemed to come to an end. The explanation often given is that the Chinese did not develop the hypothesis. Without this key piece of mental software it was impossible to make progress. Those that believe progress arises from the analysis of information and steps of logical deduction are totally wrong. Without the framework of possibilities we cannot see the information in new ways.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The green hat may be used to overcome some of the difficulties put forward under the black hat. It may suggest modifications to an idea to avoid the difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Creative thinking: new ideas, new concepts and new perceptions. The deliberate creation of new ideas. Alternatives and more alternatives. Change. New approaches to problems.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Lateral thinking in its relation to creativity. Humour and lateral thinking. Pattern switching in a self organising information system.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Movement instead of judgement. Using an idea is a stepping stone. Where does it take me? The forward effect of an idea. Movement as an active idiom. We use an idea for its movement value. With movement we use an idea for each forward effect. We use an idea to see where it will get us.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The need for provocation. Use of the word po. The logic of the absurd. Random provocation. We use provocations for their movement value. Po as an indicator that an idea was put forward as a provocation and for its movement value. The letters stand for provocative operation.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can use random words as a po. To many people it may seem unthinkable that a random word could be value in solving a problem. Random means the the word has no special relationship. In the logic of an asymmetric patterning system, it is easy to see why a random word works. It provides a different starting point. As we chase our way back from that new starting point, we increase the chance of arriving back along the track we would never have taken when thinking about the subject directly.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Alternatives. The first answer may not be the best; we acknowledge it and can always go back to it; then we look for alternatives. We create routes; different levels of alternatives. We can look at alternatives within a route (or different routes altogether). “You ask me for alternative ways of loading the trucks. I’m going to tell you that it would make more sense to send your product by train”.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Personality and skill: changing masks is is easier than changing faces - putting on a different hat changes the mask. People take pride in the exercise of a skill.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What happens to the ideas: shaping and tailoring ideas. The concept manager.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The shaping of an idea is done by bringing in constraints. They are brought in as shapers and not as a rejection screen. Part of the creative process is to shape the idea so that it better fits the need profile of those who are going to have to buy the idea.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Steps: Collect the output from green hat thinking. Next is the yellow hat stage; this includes the constructive development of the idea, the positive assessment and the search for support of benefits and values. Black hat thinking comes next. At any stage white hat thinking can be called upon to supply data required for evaluating whether the idea will work and will be valuable if it does. Final stage: red hat thinking; do we like the idea enough to proceed further?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Green hat thinking is a mix of attitudes, idioms and techniques including movement, provocation and po for cutting across patterns in a self organising asymmetric patterning system. It is used to generate new concepts and perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue hat&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For thinking about thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Control of thinking: thinking about thinking. Instructions for thinking. The organisation of thinking. Control of the other hats.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Focus: asking the right questions. Defining the problem. Setting the thinking tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Programme design: step-by-step. Software for thinking. Choreography.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The blue hat customises the programme to fit the situation, just as a carpenter plans how he’s going to make a chair or a cabinet.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Summaries and conclusions: observation and overview. Comment. Summaries, conclusions, harvesting and reports.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Control and monitoring: the chairperson. Discipline and focus. Who is in charge?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t rush some decisions. Most people rightly wouldn’t buy a house on the spur of the moment. Likewise in business many decisions have huge implications and take time to fully consider. The problem is that sometimes we go too far; we slow ourselves down by failing to recognise the decisions that can be made quickly. We miss out on a first mover advantage, the learning from doing and any benefit we’d be getting from the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos frames decisions as either “one way doors” that require careful deliberation and consultation or “two way doors”; decisions that can be reversed. Most fall into the second category. Saying that he’s been wildly successful following the model is something of an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision that pays off will make an enormous difference, but even the aggregation of small experiments builds up to something significant. In contrast, arduous processes and cycles that consume time and resources cost a fortune and land you with the cost of delay in carrying out a change as well the loss of any benefit from the knowledge a failed experiment imparts. There’s time for fast decision making, and there’s time for careful consideration; the advantage is in knowing which to utilise in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business a simple effort vs reward matrix can be used to decide what to focus on. They typically look like the one below. Low effort, high reward activities are no brainers, cherish these. If something requires a lot of effort but pays off well then that’s usually next in priority. Low effort and low reward activities are left to do only if there’s time to spare. High effort low reward should be left to the suckers, forget it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lead-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/Effort_Reward.png&quot; alt=&quot;Effort vs reward matrix&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dimension that we need to consider is potential upside (positive) vs downside (negative). Whilst the former is essentially the reward axis, there is no representation of the potential downside on the diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High potential upside, limited potential downside means you can proceed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High potential upside and downside means you should proceed with caution. In the most extreme circumstance you could destroy your business and/or reputation - at which point too much damage has been done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can think about effort vs reversibility in the same way and equally we need to consider potential upside and downside. An effort vs reversibility matrix allows the separation of things you need to be cautious about from things that you should just get on with. Framing decisions in this way provides a rule of thumb for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how much information to collect;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the level of consensus you need to build before implementing a change;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how long to wait before doing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lead-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/Effort_Reversible.png&quot; alt=&quot;Effort vs reward matrix&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For highly reversible, low effort changes: a hunch is enough to warrant just getting on with it. Spend the minimum viable time on gathering information and building consensus. The kind of changes you tend to see here are new practices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highly reversible, high effort changes need more consideration because of the opportunity cost of the invested effort. A strong hypothesis will be needed. New policies or significant changes to a delivery approach are examples of what you might find here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not easily reversible, low effort changes should be approached with high caution. There’s a tendency for the ease at which the decision can be made to influence rash or careless decision makers into doing lasting damage to a company or wasting resources. An example here would be poor hiring. A hire can be made at the drop of a hat, but if it turns out badly then the effort in recruitment, the time of the people they’ve met and the onboarding has been wasted and will need to be repeated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less reversible, high effort changes require extreme caution. Think of a company deciding on a new internal accounting system. Clearly high effort to implement and difficult to back out of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice I’ve used this approach to make decisions quickly which on the surface may have seemed reckless. If the changes hadn’t worked it would have been relatively easy to reverse. As an example, working in telecoms I had to respond to my team growing overnight to 18 people as we merged with another. Using Scrum the team size was far from ideal (cognitive load and the number of communication paths). We could have done nothing and trundled along. We didn’t spend weeks building consensus with stakeholders, running through process diagrams or debating every possible scenario. Almost instantaneously we decided (1) to go fully remote and (2) to work as two sub-teams with a couple of light touch processes to keep in sync. The changes happened within a week (which in a large corporate is almost instantaneous) and with the result of moving quickly there was no loss of momentum on the work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start looking at decisions as either reversible or irreversible it becomes easier to be someone who makes things happen. You’ll know it when you have to dig a bit deeper to find patience with people that don’t move as fast. If something is easily reversible, you just decide and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something is reversible, it’s a lot easier to be bold.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sash</name></author><category term="agile" /><category term="decisions" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="agility" /><category term="agile" /><summary type="html">Make decisions quickly and with confidence.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kaufie.com/Effort_Reversible.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kaufie.com/Effort_Reversible.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
