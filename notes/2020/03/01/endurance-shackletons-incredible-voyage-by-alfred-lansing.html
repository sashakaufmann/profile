Endurance is so well written that the whole book will have you on the edge of your seat. The story that unfolds is one of a leader able to hold his nerve whilst maintaining a group together in some of the most challenging conditions on the planet. Shackleton sets a fantastic example for leaders to follow: staying attuned to his men’s moods, knowing their strengths, weaknesses and making decisions accordingly. He set the example he wanted them to follow, led from the front and always had a clear objective. This helped keep them alive in what must have seemed an impossible situation. If you want to be entertained, inspired or to learn about leadership then this book is essential." />
